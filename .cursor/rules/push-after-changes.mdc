# Push to Git After Changes

When you finish making changes to this project (edits, new files, or fixes):

1. **Stage** the modified files (e.g. `git add <files>` or `git add -A` for all).
2. **Commit** with a clear, short message describing the change.
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push origin main` (or the current branch).

Do not skip the push step. The user expects the repo to be updated after each session of changes.

If the user says "don't push" or "skip git" for a given change, then omit the push for that turn only.
